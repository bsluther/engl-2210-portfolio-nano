### Reflection 
The purpose of this video is to teach someone how to coil a rope. While most people don't need to coil rope very often, when it does come up, it's helpful to have some basic techniques at your disposal. With that in mind, I set out to demonstrate the basics including preparation, coiling, and finishing the coil. I achieved this by showing each of these steps from start to finish, narrating the process, and noting some common mistakes along the way. The narration provides a detailed description which, when paired with the video demonstrating the techniques, gives views a clear set of steps to follow to the complete the process.

The audience for this video are non-experts who don't have prior experience coiling or managing ropes. The video format is a great fit for this audience because it enables instruction by demonstration: rather than using detailed and technical terms to describe the process, the viewer is able to understand the steps and why they are necessary. A textual or audio description would necessitate a much more detailed description without providing much additional value for a non-expert.

When I created an outline and a script for this project, I had it in mind to include more techniques and criteria to choose between them. I think this is valuable information, but the process of creating the video revealed that it was simply too much content for the targeted duration of around 5 minutes. Rather than compress more content into the target duration, I decided to focus on fewer techniques. I believe this is more effective because it allows for the requisite detail and avoids confusing the viewer by rapidly progressing through topics. I used to the editing process to trim out this excess content, which resulted in a few sharp edges, but I think overall the video still accomplishes the scoped-down goal of instructing the viewer on flaking a rope, coiling a rope, and finishing with a wrap coil.
