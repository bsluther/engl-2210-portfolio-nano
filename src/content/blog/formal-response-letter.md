### Reflection
This formal letter addresses a complaint raised by an employee. The letter sets out to acknowledge and reiterate the employees concerns, accept responsibility where appropriate, and outline any steps the company will take in response to the issue. These objectives are achieved by summarizing the concerns raised in the complaint, expressing appreciation that the complaint was raised in the first place, and then outlining the company's view and response on each facet of the complaint. I identified 3 main components of the original complaint: poor planning for disposal of steel materials, on-site communication restrictions, and staffing shortages. Each of these issues is addressed directly by describing the problem and the remediating actions that will be performed.

The letter is directly addressing the employee who raised the complaint but it's important to keep in mind that other employees working in field services and management will have access to this. Beyond that, as an official letter, it is part of the company's legal record and could be referenced by auditors, regulators, investors, or other third-parties in the future. To address these diverse parties, it is important to maintain a professional tone and make clear statements while still conveying the importance of the issue and personal investment of the author. The letter is consistently respectful and candid, expressing the position of the company clearly while addressing the concerns of the employee.

In imagining the position of the company I made the decision to accept responsibility for the lack of a disposal plan for the steel materials but deflect responsibility for the staffing shortages and on-site communication challenges. I believe this is a realistic position for a company to take and creates a more realistic challenge: how to acknowledge employee concerns while refusing to take specific action. To achieve this end, the letter describes the problems clearly and beseeches the employee to understand the constraints the company operates under. I believe that this blend of accepting and deflecting responsibility was a useful and realistic exercise in crafting a formal response letter.
